# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Start the program
### Step 2: 
Create variables for the vlaues of the coordinates
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the output rounded off to 2 decimal places
### Step 5: 
Stop the program
### PROGRAM:

x_1=10
x_2=4
y_1=6
y_2=2
d=((x_2-x_1)**2+(y_2-y_1)**2)**0.5
print(format(d,".2f"))
```
